Q3. How to combine two commits into one commit? For Example, you have 4
different commits C1, C2, C3, and  C4 and you to combine C2 and C3
into one single commit.

To combine multiple commits into 1 squashing is used
it squashes multiple commits into 1

many a time we accidently do some commmits to solve this and maintain good
commit history squash is used

command:

git rebase -i HEAD~3

so this will pull 3 commits from the log
commits which are to be squashed just write s in front of them

it will merge that with previous commit

and at end new commit message is to be added
