Q1. What is cherry-pick? Explain the use case of it also write steps to do it.

Cherry pick means to include only specific commits from a branch, many a time we dont
need all commits but just some specific commit that has the particular change or
bug fix in such case cherry pick is used

cherrypick picks the specified commit and places it in front of lastest commit

branch1 commit : a - b - c
branch2 commit : x - y

if only x commit is needed then after cherry pick:

branch1 commit a - b - c - x


Stpes:
1. do git log
2. get the commit-id of the commit you want to cherry pick
3. checkout to desired branch
4. git cherrypick [commit-id]


Code:
git cherry-pick 50f58dd1e3eded8a02179835c852ba24ecac0481
