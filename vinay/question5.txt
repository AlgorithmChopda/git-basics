Q5. Difference between --force push and --force-with-lease, You have to show the
use of both, also you have to show in what scenario --force-with-lease is used?

--force will forcefully push the changes into the remote branch, this can lead to data loss

git push origin main --force


--force-with-lease: before updating the remote It checks whether the remote branch
has been updated by others since your last fetch. If someone else has pushed changes,
the push will be rejected, preventing unintentional overwrites.

git push origin main --force-with-lease



scenario:
--force
	1. rebase
	2. when you want the local code to be exact same to main branch

--force-with-lease
	1. to avoid unintentional push
