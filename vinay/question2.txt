Multiple remote repositories can be added this multiple repo case is useful
when a project is divided into multiple repos

git remote add unique-name repo-url

working demo:
$ git remote add development https://github.com/AlgorithmChopda/sample-repo.git


$ git remote -v

development     https://github.com/AlgorithmChopda/sample-repo.git (fetch)
development     https://github.com/AlgorithmChopda/sample-repo.git (push)
origin  git@github.com:AlgorithmChopda/git-basics.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:AlgorithmChopda/git-basics.git (push)
